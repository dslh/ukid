# Use Key In Door
## A Roguelike Text Adventure

You are in a room.

The door is locked.

In the room there is a table.

On the table there is a key.

You would like to leave the room.

This shouldn't be too hard...

### Setting up

Use Key In Door consists of separate backend and frontend applications that you will need to run in order to play. See `backend/README.md` and `frontend/README.md` for details on getting them set up and running.

You'll also need to run a MongoDB instance for saving game data. Run `docker compose up` from the `backend/` directory. You have docker installed, right?
